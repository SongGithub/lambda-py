# Lambda Python

> some of my work around AWS-Lambda

## List of Functions

- download source code off Github in Python, so that lambda using Py as run time
can consume

- get CloudFormation stack tags

## Get Started

- to run Python with common settings, in a dockerised environment which
provides dependency isolation, as well as standard Linux runtime, please run:

```
     docker-compose run python <your actual command>
```

- or maybe you want to hop inside the docker container:
```
    docker-compose run python bash
```
